## 🔍 Summary

VPNs enhance privacy by encrypting all outgoing traffic and masking the user's IP address. This makes it harder for third parties to track browsing behavior. However, VPNs can slow down connections and free versions often have limitations. Browser hygiene is equally important — removing shady extensions reduces risk of data leakage and enhances overall security.
